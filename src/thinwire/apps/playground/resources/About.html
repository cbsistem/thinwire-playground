<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
First, thanks for checking out the ThinWire&reg; Ajax Framework. We have been
working around the clock to make this framework the fastest, most powerful and
browser-independent Ajax framework ever. As it stands now, this exact
application can run in Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari and even the slimed down
Opera browser on the Nokia 770 Tablet PDA. Even with all the new features
included in this release, the framework remains light and fast. So read on to
learn about the Playground and what it can teach you about the ThinWire&reg;
Ajax Framework.
</p>

<h3>Playground Brings Everything Together</h3>
<p> 
In short, the Playground allows you to interact with most of the UI
components that ThinWire&reg; includes.  When we say interact, we're
not talking about just being able to look at a component and click
on a button or two.  Playground goes beyond the basics in a number of
ways.  For instance, right after you click on a component, you can
click on the "Component Help" tab to read the applicable API documentation
for the component.
</p>

<h3>Properties and Styles</h3>
<p>
Additionally, you can use the "Properties" and "Style" tabs to manipulate the
real-time state of any component, so you can see the results visually.  Another
benefit of this is that you can quickly see all the properties and
styles that a given component supports.  This makes finding programming
information just a tad quicker than pulling up the javadoc.  For instance,
if you see a propertyName called "text", then you know the component has
both a "String getText()" method and "void setText(String text)" method.
</p>

<h3>Event Types and Event Listeners</h3>
<p>
Taking it a step further, you can use the "Events" tab to activate any event
listener that the component supports. So why do that? Well, after you activate
an event listener, the panel at the bottom of the "Events" tab will display
real-time output anytime the component's state changes in a way that triggers
the specified event. So for example, pull up the Button component, and then
check the box for "ActionListener click". Now click the Button
and you'll see that the button has been clicked in the "Event History" report.
</p>

<h3>Source Code, Generated Just For You</h3>
<p>
So you've worked your way through the properties, styles and events and now you've
got that Button looking just like you want. Only problem is, how do you write the
code that will create your customized button?  Well, with the Playground you just
click the "Source Code" tab and presto, the source code for your component
appears.  And we're not talking about some prefab cookie-cutter source code.
Nope, the Playground generates the code necessary to create the exact component
you've been playing with.  And as a bonus, it'll even generate the event listener
stubs for the event types you check on the "Events" tab.
</p>

<h3>Special Examples</h3>
<p>
The Playground does provide the opportunity to play with all the ThinWire components.  
In addition to being able to manipulate properties, styles, and listeners, and generate 
source code, there are some special examples that we have prepared.  These are things
that either aren't demonstrated well by the rest of the Playground, or we feel are so special
that they need to be highlighted.
</p>

<h3>Some Lesser Known Cool Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Real-Time edit masking is super-cool... it's a behind the scene feature that
doesn't get a lot of attention in the Ajax buzz world, but give it a shot and we're
sure you'll never want to edit data without it.  Just pull up the TextField component
and set the editMask property to something like "(999) 999-9999" and then try and type into
the field.</li>
<li>You can drag the divider that separates the left and right side of the application.  You can
also drag and resize the divider that separates the properties tab folder from the playground.</li>
</ul>
